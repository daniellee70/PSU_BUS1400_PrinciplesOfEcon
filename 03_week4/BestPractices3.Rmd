## Summary

| Causes of Recessions    | How it works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Examples |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| monetary policy         | The Fed can slow the economy by tightening monetary policy, which decreases the money supply and/or raises interest rates.                                                                                                                                   |          |
| supply shocks           | A sudden increase in an essential commodity can tip the economy into recession. A good example is the oil crisis of the 1970s.                                                                                                                               |          |
| credit crunches         | Banks play a critical role in the economy by funding business operations and production and individuals for their purchases of big-ticket items like houses or cars. When loans become unavailable (credit crunches), the economy can fall into recession.   |          |
| optimism and pessimism  | Listen to the everyday business managers to gauge the level of uncertainty in the economy. When they start sounding gloomy, a recession may be around the corner.                                                                                            |          |
| consumer confidence     | In some economies, consumer spending plays a critical role. The United States is a good example. A sudden and wide swing in consumer confidence can influence the economy.                                                                                   |          |
| fiscal policy           | Increased government spending, such as new highways and aircraft carriers, can stimulate the economy. The government can also use taxes to influence the economy. For example, a tax reduction would leave more money for consumers to spend and vice versa. |          |
| foreign business cycles | A recession in an essential trading country can influence the domestic economy. For example, a Canadian recession can negatively affect the economy in the northern border regions of the United States that heavily rely on trade with Canada.              |          |
| trade wars              | Restrictions on foreign trade reduce our exports to the foreign country and thus can be recessionary. The Great Depression is a good example.                                                                                                                |          |
| speculative mania       | An asset price bubble and the following crash can contribute to a recession. When asset prices crash, consumers feel less wealthy and decrease spending.                                                                                                     |          |
