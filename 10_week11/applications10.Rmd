Assume Daewoo, a hypothetical oil extraction company, has the following cost structure. It spends:

•	$40/barrel on labor costs, raw materials, energy, and
•	$35/barrel on interest, depreciation, insurance, and administrative staff expense.

Read the textbook carefully, and answer the following questions.

* A recession hits, the market price of crude oil falls to $50 per barrel, and the profitability takes a hit. Should Daewook keep running the mine? Elaborate.
* Russia invades Ukraine, the market price shoots up well above $100 per barrel, and competitors announce new expansion plans. Should Daewoo add the new capacity? Elaborate.

***Place your answer here.***
